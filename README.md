# ASimpleIoT
A simple IoT demo based on NodeMcu, mqtt over WiFi

* We will use this hardware http://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html
* We will use this light weight technology for communications over WiFi http://mqtt.org/
* Install the latest Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
* To recognize and program the hardware, follow the steps mentioned here: https://www.hackster.io/Aritro/getting-started-with-esp-nodemcu-using-arduinoide-aa7267
* We will use the MQTT library from adafruit, set it up as follows: https://learn.adafruit.com/mqtt-adafruit-io-and-you/arduino-plus-library-setup
* To view and control the IoT setup over phone, we use this app, MQTT client and Dashboard on phone: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=snr.lab.iotmqttpanel.prod
* To route the MQTT traffic, we use the MQTT broker or server: (On linux/ubuntu machine use apt-get) or on the phone use https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=server.com.mqtt
